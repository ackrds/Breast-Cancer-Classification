# Breast-Cancer-Classification

This is a basic transfer learning classification project I wrote for a Kaggle competition.
Make sure you have plenty of space on your computer or use a Kaggle Notebook as the dataset is huge.
There is a class imbalance between healthy and cancer patients so I created a function to remedy that.
